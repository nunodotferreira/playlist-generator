# Playlist Generator

Playlist Generator is a small PHP webapp which takes a directory containing music files in the format:

~~~
Artist Name - Album Name (Year)/00 Track Name.mp3
Artist Name - Album Name (Year)/AlbumArt.jpg
~~~

and generates HTML5 playlists using [audio.js](https://github.com/kolber/audiojs) and its "customized playlist player" template.

The player should work in any modern desktop/mobile browser, with all the same caveats and limitations of audio.js.

The files generated by this are in the format:

~~~
Artist Name - Album Name (Year).html
Artist Name - Album Name (Year).jpg
~~~

## Usage

Clone git repository into webserver directory.

Upload music into same directory in the format above.

Requires PHP and GD.
